With 3+ years assessing individual and employee behavior and organizational research, my areas of interest broadly include data analytics and visualization, psychometrics, and understanding employee preferences and behavior.

I am in the Ph.D. program at Louisiana Tech University in Industrial and Organizational Psychology. My research focuses on Markov analyses, workforce planning, bias in selection systems, utility and adverse impact, and reconciling rater differences in job analysis. I have published articles in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology, Journal of Positive Psychology, and Journal of Business Diversity. Christina is currently a member of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP), International Personnel Assessment Council (IPAC), and Association for Psychological Science (APS).
