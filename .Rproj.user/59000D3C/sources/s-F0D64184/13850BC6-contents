abstract: Job analysis is an important tool underlying several organizational functions
  including performance appraisals, selection, and training. Typical job analyses
  are conducted with a random, stratified sample of subject matter experts (SMEs).
  These individuals are often job incumbents who are asked to rate and make judgments
  concerning the frequency and importance of job tasks. It is presumed that incumbents
  who perform a job should evaluate it similarly. Accordingly, it may be concerning
  if there is significant variance in employees’ job analysis ratings depending on
  what is causing the differences. As such, job analysts must determine if rating
  differences are legitimate (“real”) or due to error. This review provides an overview
  of various statistical techniques that can be used to assess the significance of
  between-group differences in job analysis ratings and how they can be used by job
  analysis experts to determine the extent to which SME ratings are consistent. In
  addition to detecting rating differences among SME groups, we also provide practical
  recommendations for reconciling those differences, if necessary.
summary: This review provides an overview of various statistical techniques that can
  be used to assess the significance of between-group differences in job analysis
  ratings and how they can be used by job analysis experts to determine the extent
  to which SME ratings are consistent.
